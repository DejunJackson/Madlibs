## Description
Madlibs is a fun game to play with friends where each person picks a random set of words that is used to fill out a random story.
Looking at the market, I didn't see many quality Online versions of this fun game. 
So I decided to build one, using what I learned and am learning using python as the main game loop and MySQL as a database to hold info from each player.
The game features a voting system, so the person with the funniest stories win and ups their score and a leaderboard to track the highest scores.
So far this, this is only a console based prototype, but it will continue to evolve!

#### Technologies

- Python
- MySQL

## How To Use

1. Copy this link: https://github.com/DejunJackson/Madlibs.git or go to the main page of the Github Repo and select the green "Code" button.
2. Open a terminal emulator on your desktop, Mac the application “Terminal” should be installed by default. Windows users will have “Windows PowerShell” or “Command Prompt”.
3. Change directory to the place you'd like the file to be stored, eg. cd -file path
4. In the desired location type "git clone" and paste the link from step 1.
5. cd or navigate into the folder you just created.
6. To run the program, enter "python app.py".
7. Grab a friend and enjoy!

## Next Steps

A short list of features that I plan to add in the near future:
- Better error handling, so the program won't crash after an error.
- Websockets, so users can connect and play on different devices.
- A graphical user interface, to make the game more visual appealing.
- Authentication, so users can have accounts etc.
